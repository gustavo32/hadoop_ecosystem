<h3>Hadoop Ecosystem Course</h3>
<p>
Here I present my journey to learn the Hadoop ecosystem. The content follows <a href='https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-hands-on-hadoop-tame-your-big-data/'>The Ultimate Hands-On Hadoop</a> course.<br/>
For now, the studied subjects are:
<ul>
    <li>HDFS</li>
    <li>MapReduce</li>
    <li>Pig</li>
    <li>Spark (RDD, Datasets, MLLib)</li>
</ul>

For most of these subjects, you can see scripts dealing with the main concepts of each technology.
